# Wordle-Unibuc-Project
The optimal solution for Wordle, written for a uni assignment @The University of Bucharest. Courtesy to 3b1b for explaining us the entropy "algorithm" used in project in his video https://youtu.be/v68zYyaEmEA. We got our 11 thousand words from https://cs.unibuc.ro/~crusu/asc/cuvinte_wordle.txt and they are in Romanian.
